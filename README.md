### Hi there 👋

<!--
**martalexaa/martalexaa** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

<p>🔭 I’m currently working on completing a full-stack web development bootcamp at Careerfoundry. As I near the completion of this program, I'm simultaneously looking for my first job as a web developer. To gain experience and contribute meaningfully to society, I am dedicating my spare time to a charitable initiative as a volunteer for a TechFleet project.
<p>🌱 I’m currently learning Angular.</p>
<p>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects that challenge me and allow me to learn from others.</p>
<p>💬 Ask me about my experience in web development, the bootcamp, or any of the specific skills I've learned.</p>
<p>📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through my GitHub page or send me an email at martalexa@gmail.com.</p>
<p>😄 Pronouns: She/Her.</p>
<p>⚡ Fun fact: From time to time I also translate books from Polish to Hungarian and I'm a huge fan of audiobooks.</p>

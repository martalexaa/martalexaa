<p>ðŸ”­ I've finished a full-stack web development bootcamp at Careerfoundry.

<p>ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web development projects that challenge me and allow me to learn from others.</p>
<p>ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience in web development, the bootcamp, or any of the specific skills I've learned.</p>
